1. Error handling seems to be minimal. Consider adding more detailed error messages and using appropriate HTTP status codes for different error scenarios.
For instance when checking for required input, instead of a generic 500 status,provide a more descriptive error message and use a 400 Bad Request status code.

2. Maintain consistent indentation throughout the code for better readability.
Ensure consistent use of quotes (single or double) for string literals.

3. There's a duplicated variable name (hashSum) within the same scope. It might lead to confusion. Consider using a different name for one of them to avoid potential bugs.

4. Ensure that the code handles file uploads securely.

5. Replace magic numbers and strings with named constants or configuration variables.

6. Consider breaking down the code into smaller functions to improve readability and maintainability.

7. There are commented-out sections in the code. Remove unnecessary or commented-out code to maintain clarity.
 
8. The function is quite lengthy. Consider breaking it down into smaller pieces.
